> Building tools that make programming languages more accessible, verifiable, and fun. From teaching OCaml to thousands of students to parsing the depths of POSIX shell.

## Currently: Tezos Blockchain

I'm currently **Head of Engineering** working on the **[Tezos](https://tezos.com)** blockchain, a self-amending cryptographic ledger built with OCaml. My work focuses on:

- **Tezos Protocol Development** - Core blockchain infrastructure in OCaml, leveraging strong types for safety-critical code
- **Smart Rollups** - Layer 2 scaling solutions for high-throughput decentralized applications
- **Tezos X** - Next-generation blockchain architecture and tooling
- **Formal Verification** - Applying rigorous methods to ensure smart contract correctness
- **Programming Language Design** - Contributing to Michelson and high-level smart contract languages

## Latest Writing

### [A Short History of Software Development](https://x.com/yurug/status/2015378992153481484)

> *"The code agents crisis adds a new parameter to software engineering: machines now also write code for humans and machines."*

From punched cards to AI code agents—how each crisis in software history emerged not from lack of power, but from a mismatch between what became cheap and what remained hard. Code agents make production cheap at unprecedented scale, but they don't make meaning cheap. The next phase of software engineering will be defined by the disciplines we invent to keep capability aligned with human intent.

**Key insight:** For the first time, the cost of *validating* software can dominate the cost of *building* it.

### Philosophy

> "Types are not just for catching bugs—they're a language for expressing intent."

I believe in building tools that teach as they work, making complex concepts approachable without sacrificing rigor.

<summary>Random Facts</summary>

- I've spent countless hours understanding why JavaScript's semicolon insertion is the way it is
- I think OCaml is an excellent first programming language
- I write fiction and built a tool to track my word counts
- I believe terminal applications can be beautiful
- The Loire Valley is the best place for thinking about abstract syntax trees
